Create Admin NAV
create category : for admin to CRUD categories visually in the FE.



AFTER RATING :
case 1.Logged In  usercan Rate.
case 2: Not logged in user will have to logIn to Rate
case 2.a=> When user logn In to rate, he/she needs to be redirected


STEPS TO SHOW SELECTED STAR RATINGS,by the user, in the FRONTEND
STEPS:
- included another useEffect

-- checked if product.ratings and user exists

- If they exist, we search for ratings object in the product object and see if user has already rated the product and store that in a variable named existingRatingObject

- if yes, we setStar to existingratingObject.stars

- existingRatingObject =product.ratings

//So far we have done a lot of things
- Add to cart, when user adds any products to cart- save the item in local storage
- so that we can send the saved item in LOcalStorage to the Backend


//after payment
- when payment is successfull , that is stauts : succeded
- we will delete the products from cart of the user
- and create order , so that admin can see and take the further steps
